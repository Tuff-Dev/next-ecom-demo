## Overview

Created an intelligent interview practice platform that simulates technical interviews using AI. The application provides real-time feedback on answers, tracks progress across multiple sessions, and adapts to different difficulty levels and topics.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Feedback**: Integrated OpenAI to analyze user responses and provide detailed, contextual feedback on technical answers.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Built a responsive chat interface that simulates a natural interview flow between the user and AI interviewer.
- **Progress Tracking**: Implemented a comprehensive progress tracking system that monitors user performance across different sessions and question types.
- **Session Management**: Developed a flexible session system that allows users to practice interviews of varying difficulty levels and technical topics.
- **Real-time Updates**: Created a seamless experience with immediate feedback and progress updates using Next.js server components and API routes.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and API routes
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **Prisma**: For database management and type-safe queries
- **OpenAI API**: For intelligent answer evaluation
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling
- **Shadcn UI**: For consistent and accessible UI components
- **PostgreSQL**: For data persistence
- **Clerk**: For authentication and user management

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was implementing accurate answer evaluation using AI. The solution involved carefully crafting prompts and using structured outputs to ensure consistent and helpful feedback. Another challenge was managing the interview flow state and ensuring a smooth user experience while handling asynchronous AI responses.

The project provided valuable insights into:

- Structuring Next.js applications for optimal performance
- Implementing type-safe database operations with Prisma
- Managing complex state in chat-like interfaces
- Integrating AI services effectively
- Building accessible and responsive UI components

## Outcome

The platform successfully provides developers with a realistic interview practice environment, complete with immediate feedback and progress tracking. The combination of AI-powered evaluation and structured learning paths helps users improve their technical interview skills systematically.
